- 👋 Hi, I’m @Clinscott
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. So much learning to do. So much knowledge to take in. It never really ends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning phaser.js in the hopes to broaden my knowledge of JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to best learn! There is so much out there, interesting and exciting.
